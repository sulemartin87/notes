# Bash

Using Bash and the terminal for greater computer productivity

## Managing Aliases

An **alias** is a bash command shortcut. You run the shortcut name, and it executes the longer function you store. It's great to save and quickly use common commands.

Assuming you're using ZSH like me, here's two useful commands to add to your aliases file right now:

```
alias viewali="cat ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/aliases.zsh"
alias editali="cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom && vim aliases.zsh"
```

* Run `viewali` to see your alias list.
* Run `editali` to edit your alias list.

Another useful alias trick is one that can open a repo while also getting it running locally all at once. For example, here's my current alias that opens my personal site in a code editor while getting the local version up.

```
alias mysite="cd ~/Documents/gatsby-blog && code . && yarn develop"
```

* First it navigates to the folder with my site's code
* Then it uses a [VSC code shortcut](./../LearningProgress/SmallWins.md#07-11-2018) to open up the repo
* Runs `yarn develop`, which is the repo's script to spin up the site

Viola! One command to get you into working mode.

## Script Files

Script files end in `*.sh`, and are used to store bash commands. Run the file, and run the command(s) in that file.

To get a script file working, you need to:

* Make sure your script is in the PATH directly, which is where most scripts should go. Run `echo $PATH` to see where it is.
* Have `#!/bin/bash` as a comment on the first line
* Run `chmod +x <filename.sh>`

Then you can just run `<filename.sh>` and run the script!

## Saving Commands with Parameters

Write a function like this in a script file, and it'll take parameters. You could write it directly in an alias file if it's short. If it's long, put it in a separate file and reference it via the alias file or the script method above.

Each parameter is referenced by it's order in the same format. First one is `$1`, second is `$2`, and so on.

```
testfunction() {
  echo "Parameter #1 is $1"
}

testfunction foo!
// "Parameter #1 is $foo!"
```

## Fixing an Old Command

If you want to change a command you just ran, running this pops it back with some characters replaced. Note that only the first instance of the string is replaced, not each one.

```
ls foo
^foo^bar

ls bar
```

Running the first two commands makes the last one pop back up. You can make a few more tweaks or run it again.
