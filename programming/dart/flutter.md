## Rules

### JSON parsing

- an object is called a map in dart

- begins with curly braces = **map** basically a javascript object

  ```json
  {
    "id":"487349",
    "name":"Pooja Bhaumik",
    "score" : 1000
  }
  ```

- begins with square brackets = **list** basically and array

## Create json parser from json 

â€‹	go to ['app.quicktype.io'](https://app.quicktype.io/)

  - paste json and get a classes from it

    use a try catch method when getting data in getusers for example

    return an empty user class when it fails or show an error somehow

- auth.login returns a message in the response and a user class as an instance 

- goes to userprovider to set user 

- find out what that does
