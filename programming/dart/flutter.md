## Rules

### JSON parsing

- an object is called a map in dart

- begins with curly braces = **map** basically a javascript object

  ```json
  {
    "id":"487349",
    "name":"Pooja Bhaumik",
    "score" : 1000
  }
  ```

- begins with square brackets = **list** basically and array
