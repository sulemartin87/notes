# Clean Code

Clean Code is a huge, useful book on scalable, maintainable code. To many it is a bible or career-changer. That's why it has its own folder.

In a 10:1 ratio, coders spend more time reading code than writing code. So making code easier to read affects our work a huge amount, so code should be explicit and easy to understand.

Leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. This prevents code rot without relying too much on unrealistic revamps.

All notes in this section have [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) as a resource.
