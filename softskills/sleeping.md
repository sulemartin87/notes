# Sleeping

Rest ain't laziness when it keeps you awake on the job

### Prioritize Sleep

One hour of sleep is several hours of energy and focus the next day. **Never think it's more productive to stay up late working than to go to bed early.** More sleep ultimately is always better for your work, health, and happiness.

### Turn your Clock Away

Being constantly reminded of the time only creates anxiety about how much sleep you haven't gotten yet. You can still hear the alarm no matter what direction it faces.

### Avoid Screens an Hour Before Bed

Phones or televisions put your brain on high alert. Step away from them so your mind has time to cool down. This includes keeping your phone away from the bed - put it in another room while you sleep. The hour before bed should be whatever you can to put your stresses behind you and unwind.

### Avoid Unfamiliar Scents

Scents meant to relax, like lavendar, will make you alert if they're unfamiliar. Familiar scents are much better at relaxing you. Significant other's clothes are a good example of this.

### Stretch Before Bed

Stretching helps relax your body and will make it easy to settle in when sleeping, with less tossing and turning to get comfortable.

### Only Use the Bed for Sleeping

The more your bed is only associated with feelings of rest, the faster you can fall asleep on it. Don't use it for relaxation tasks that also keep you up like reading, television, gaming, or anything. Your body should associate the feeling of your bed with "time to pass out" and nothing else.

### Don't Linger Restlessly in Bed

If you're in bed at least 20 minutes and can't sleep, don't stew in the sheets. Get up and do something else to relax your mind, like read a book or stretch. Once you feel calmer, give the bed another shot.

### Check for Pre-Bed Caffeine

Some painkillers or other medicine have caffeine, which will be listed as an active ingredient. Always check the label and avoid it if possible.
