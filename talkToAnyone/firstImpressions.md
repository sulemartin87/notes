# First Impressions

## The Flooding Smile

When smiling at someone, pause first before visibly moving from neutral expression to "flooding smile." This sends a message that your smile is in response to seeing them and giving them a positive impression that you find them special.

## Sticky Eyes

Keep near-constant eye contact with the other person, even when they're not talking. If you look away, do so slowly and reluctantly.

## Epoxy Eyes

Same as Sticky Eyes, but keep watching the other person even when someone else is talking. A more subtle version of this is bouncing your gaze to your target when another person finishes speaking, showing you're interested in their reactions.

## Hang By Your Teeth

For better posture when entering a room, imagine an iron-jaw bit hanging from the door frame. Bite it and let it pull you up to a tall, strong posture. If this doesn't work, imagine a string on your chest pulling your forward and upward, at around a 45-degree angle.

## The Big-Baby Pivot

When being introduced to, or meeting someone, make a large pivot towards them. Point your body towards them, smile wide, and give your undivided attention. Another good way to subtly tell someone you find them special.

## Hello Old Friend

When meeting someone, imagine you're reuniting with a long lost friend. This helps position your body language and communication to be much more relaxed and familiar.

## Limit the Fidget

Avoid fidgeting, scratching, squirming, or any related behaviors when talking with others. These give the impression you're lying or being dishonest, even if you're not.

## Han's Horse Sense

Always watch how your target is responding and reaction to a conversation. Adjust the topic, and your body language, accordingly.

## Watch the Scene Before You Make a Scene

Visualize steps 1-8 in advance whenever possible to boost your confidence and improve execution.
