# Talking like an Important Person

## What Do You Do...NOT!

Don't ask someone "what do yo do?" Ask instead "how do you spend most of your time?" This lets people answer with their passions and larger interests, not just their job.

## The Nutshell Resume

Take your audience into account when describing yourself. Choose whether to focus on your work, health, personal life, or other life interests. Have some simple self-introductions planned from different angles.

## Your Personal Thesaurus

Sound smarter by looking up similar words to common ones you already know in a thesaurus. Substitute lots of different synonyms throughout your speech.

## Kill the Quick "Me, Too!"

Don't reveal things you have in common with others right away, or you come across as desperate. The longer you wait, the more impressed and positively affected the listener will be.

## Comm-YOU-nication

Start each sentence with "you" and sprinkle it throughout the conversation. It presses your listener's pride button and makes them more receptive.

## The Exclusive Smile

Try to form a distinct smile for different people, and include other specific gestures, emotions, or reactions for them as well.

## Don't Touch a Cliche with a Ten-Foot Pole

Don't use cliches. 'Nuff said.

## Use JawSmith's Jive

Look up good prose for speaking to specific audiences. They can come from speaker quotations, pearls of wisdom, or funny insights. They're good, even if they're common, as long as they don't qualify as universal cliches.

## Call a Spade a Spade

Try to avoid euphamisms for common items. You know the words for things, use them.

## Trash the Teasing

Never make a joke at another person's expense! Short-term laugh, but often long-term pain or consequences.

## It's the Receiver's Ball

Always keep the receiver in mind when delivering news or other information. Know how they'll likely react and mirror that reaction when passing them the news.

## The Broken Record

When being asked about an unwelcome subject, give a basic, plannned response. If continually asked, keep repeating the same answer with the same tone, volume, and inflection. No matter how many times it takes.

## Big Shots Don't Slobber

Don't slobber over, or mindlessly compliment, big shots you talk with. Talk about how much pleasure their work gives you, and if you single out an accomplishment make sure it's recent. Involve others in the conversation if they're nearby.

## Never the Naked Thank You

Never just say "thank you." Always follow it up with the specific thing you're thankful for, with a framework like "thank you for X."
