# Creating Fast Connections

## Be a Copyclass

Watch your target's body language and match their movements as closely as possible. This includes common gestures, movement speeds, rhythm of motion, and larger poses.

## Echoing

Pick up on your target's choice of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc, and echo them back in your own words. This creates subliminal report.

## Potent Imaging

Find out your target's interests and base language metaphors around them. For example, someone who likes boating will like to hear about an idea "holding water" or a good plan "setting sail."

## Employ Empathizers

Sprinkle conversations with small phrases that show you're listening and understanding what someone is saying. Phrases like "I see what you mean," "that's a lovely thing to say," or "that's a very fair point."

## Anatomically Correct Empathizers

Base your empathizers around your target's primary sensory inputs. If they're more visual and use eye/visual metaphors, then use the empathizer of "I see what you mean."

## The Premature "We"

Use the word "we" when talking about you and your target to subliminally plant the ideas of closeness and intimacy.

## Instant History

Bring up special or memorable moments at a first encounter with someone. This helps create a sense of shared history.
