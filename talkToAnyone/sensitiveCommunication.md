# Sensitive Communication

## See No Bloopers, Hear No Bloopers

Never acknowledge or make fun of, in any way, your target's mistakes or bloopers.

## Lend a Helping Tongue

When someone's anecdote is interrupted, let the interruption play out before notioning the storyteller to resume it. Bonus points if you mention the last details they mentioned before getting stopped.

## Bare the Buried "What's in it For Me" (and What's in it For You)

If you have an agenda for a meeting, be honest about what's in it for both of you to avoid seeming manipulative.

## Let 'Em Savor the Favor

When someone owes you a favor, wait at least 24 hours before making them repay it. This lets them savor the joy of being generous.

## Tit for (Wait...wait) Tat

Basically the same as the above - when someone owes you, wait before calling it in. It creates the impression you did their initial favor more out of friendship.

## Parties are for Pratter

Never bring up tough moments or confrontations during parties. They're sacred havens for fun times.

## Dinner's for Dining

Dinner and other meals are also safe havens and should not have any tough business brought up.

## Chance Encounters are for Chitchat

Chance encounters are the third safe haven from all tough business.

## Empty Their Tanks

When someone else needs to talk, let them talk until they're done and tired. That's when you can start bringing yourself into the conversation.

## Echo the Emo

When someone is emptying their tank with you, be sure to also empathize with them and echo whatever their emotions are.

## My Goof, Your Gain

If you ever make a mistake, find a way to spin your mistake in a way that your target will benefit from.

## Leave an Escape Hatch

If you catch someone lying or being dishonest in any way, and you don't need to confront them directly, don't do it. Keep it in mind if needed, but otherwise don't bring it back up.

## Buttercups for Their Boss

If you want to appeal to someone, leave a positive note about them to their boss.

## Lead the Listeners

When someone is speaking publically, try to be the first to give a positive response when they're done (such as apploauding or public appreciation).

## The Great Scorecard in the Sky

In any relationship with someone, there's a scorecard of whose contributed most and whose withdrawn most. Good actions add to the scorecard, and negative actions take away from it. Always keep track of this "great scorecard" to know if you're in deference to the other person and need to add a few points later on.
