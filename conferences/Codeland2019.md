# Codeland 2019

## Opening

* Be curious (duh)
* Be bold with meeting others
* Be playful with ideas
* Absurd dance? Also, how does slowly waving your arms back equate to being on top of a train?

## Laughter as a Serious Weapon

* "Equitable" app, using "affirmative fractions"
* Laughter to help break down negative pushback to social justice. Done throughout the entire process of the app.
* We have the info and lived experiences already to start making this kind of change.

## John Crepezei. Hardware Hacking

* Intersection of MikeHaven and code?
* Code executing actions for real objects
* Raspberry Pi, coding timing for music
  * L298N connected to Rasp Pi
  * Different add-ons to extend it

## Fighting Hurricanes with Code

* Coding drones to scan areas for SOS calls that pass on to first responders.
* Could also scan for drawings
* Log all entries on a map
* Necessity drives this innovation
* Purpose larger than oneself

## Vuejs Workshop

Framework perk is not making as many repetitive, unneeded decisions like "where to put crop." Vue is simpler, no build process, scalable

### Perks

* Two-way binding between DOM and JS
* HTML with template rendering / declarative rendering / logic and variables.
* Can do either the CLI setup or paste the script tag in the file.
* Vue can limit itself to parts of the DOM, controls scale and limits scope.
* Less barrier between HTML and JS. Logical rendering in the template, more flexible than other frameworks.
* `v-model` for two-way bindings, form inputs automatically change them.
* Events defined in "methods," many event shortcuts to use in the HTML.
  * v:on-click or @click, check syntax options!
* Bind specific values to attributes, classes or otherwise. Good for disabling inputs.

### Lifecycle Events

* Different points in creating and destroying the DOM. for examples geting Aft when created hook is called.
* filters are value formatters, passed through in a pipe in the template. Also can be done in the JS side or with arguments.

### Components

* Reusable functionality and templates.
* Store the usual Vue properties along with a template
* Define props and needed logic
* Can take in parent data
* listen for events
* Slots for passing blocks as variables, and exposes data for use in the blocks.

### Page enhancements VS apps

* For apps, use Code Sandbox. Lays out and adds files for you.
* Single-file components!
  * You can serve one component instead of the whole app.
* The CLI does not add `vue-router` for you. Has programmatic options too, like checking logic to block certain paths.

### State management

* Many components with one data set gets tough.
* Vuex is seperate, which acts as a "store." which keeps all the data. Changes to it notify all areas using them.
* Can be one or more store instances
* Mutations and Actions are how data is changed. Big difference is Actions are async, good for APIs.
* Devtools extension for using store and other Vue features

### Resources

* Check Drasner's Vue articles on CSS Tricks
* Vue docs cookbook for building examples
* Ray Camden's blog's, look for the Vue tag
* Check out Unit tests, also integration tests
* Custom directives?

## You Should Write that Blog Post

* Writing for past, present, and future self. Selfish at its core but that's okay.
* Present self to fuel learning new things
* Future self to establish one's career


## Building a Gendered Dictionary

* Gendered language with built-in meaning slanted to a gender. Has a gender as part of the definition
* Using regex to precisely look for gendered words in a data collection of definitions.
* Had to filter data to only include human-based words too.
* The language we use potentially reinforces stereotypes and inequalities.

## Art Meets Algorithms

Pixels in an image are basically a graph,trying to solve the route shortest between them all.

1. Convert image to pixels
2. select a subset of all the pixels at random
3. Randomness to create a randomized pixel selection (1 from each 3Ã—3 grid)
4. Apply "nearest neighbors algorithm" to create line art. But doesn't work since it has several long jumps, too simple
5. Remove long lines with "2- opt" algorithm. Remove all line pairs that cross and replace them with non-crossers

Also check out fractal art and voronoi diagrams.
